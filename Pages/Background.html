            I was born on October 16th 1999 to two wonderful parents, Troy and Marney Salmond<br>
            I was the third child born and the youngest after my older sister and older brother Yaasmeen and Hakim<br>
            I soon became the middle child after my younger brother and sister were born Bilal and Kinaya making the total sibling count 5

                        In middle school I became interested in concert music and became a band major after middle school, <br>
                        I auditioned for a new and upcoming performing arts magnet school named Martha Ellen Stilwell <br>
                        I got accepted and for the next four years I attended, in 2018 I finally graduated with a fine arts seal,<br>
                        and from Stilwell I went to college at Columbus State University where I studied as a computer science Major<br>
                        I only attended for 1 year however, as I didnt like the program, from CSU I heard about Per Scholas from a cousin who attended in New York<br>
                        and lucky enough for me the program was in Georgia, I did two full courses and graduated from both classes from these classes <br>
                        I earned my ITF+ and A+ certfications in I.T and now im taking another Per Scholas course for Software Engineering where I can finally hone my coding skills.
